## Git branch control rule:

#### 1. development branch:

The development branch is used to assemble code during application development. 
Note, always pull the code from development to update the latest version to avoid config git error.

Move to your function branch
```shell
git checkout <your-function-branch>
```
Get latest version code from development branch
```shell
git pull origin development
```
#### 2. create new function branch:

Name rule: feature/function-name

#### 3. commit code:

Just commit your coding file to avoid config git error.

#### 4. pull request:

Make sure the code is working and has updated to the latest version from development before making a pull request.
